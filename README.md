# hatchtest

## Objective: Create an API wrapper that includes 2-4 of end points.

Result: Sadly the The Cat API was broken in multiple ways, and I could only reliably get couple of GETs.. which really made this barely enough to qualify.

The actual API wrapper is under <https://github.com/russiansmack/thecatapiwrapper>
